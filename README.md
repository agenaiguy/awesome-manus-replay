49. **Dashboard for LBO Targets Analysis in Japan**  
   - **Description**: Please build a dashboard for me that summarizes an analysis of suitable LBO targets in Japan. Ideal targets are listed companies that trade below 5x EV/EBITDA, less than $2bn in EV, no controlling or dominant shareholder above 20% ownership, relatively stable or positive business momentum in industries that are generally benefiting from tailwinds. The dashboard should show historical financial information and projections going forward, and a graphical depiction of the capital structure (cash vs debt), and an LBO analysis. Please give me the top 5 targets. OK, let’s keep going:  
     - [x] Set up project directory and install required libraries  
     - [x] Define detailed LBO criteria parameters  
     - [ ] Collect data on Japanese listed companies  
     - [ ] Implement filtering based on financial criteria  
     - [ ] Analyze shareholder structure for controlling interests  
     - [ ] Assess business performance and industry outlook  
     - [ ] Create LBO models for top candidates  
     - [ ] Develop visualizations for capital structure  
     - [ ] Build comprehensive dashboard with all analyses  
     Let’s spruce it up, and style it like a 90’s style Japanese video game. Can you render it as a fully hosted HTML instead? You’ll get a lot more creative juice out of it. Sandbox not found, please redeploy. Great, let’s get a permanent deployment link, this is awesome. I’ve also noticed that the background image is from Imgur, and probably needs to be downloaded instead of referenced directly in the HTML. Can we add a language selector between ENGLISH | 中文 at the top and then translate the rest of the app based on that? OK, let’s revert all of those changes to just the English language one, this one doesn’t look very good.
